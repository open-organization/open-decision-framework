# Open Decision Framework
A community version of the Open Decision Framework

## Background
For the past few years at Red Hat, we’ve been grappling with the challenges of growing an open organization and sustaining our culture along the way. One tool we’ve been developing and testing is the Open Decision Framework, a collection of best practices for applying [open source principles](https://opensource.com/open-source-way) to business projects and decisions. 

The Open Decision Framework contains the collective wisdom of Red Hatters, compiled into a flexible framework that helps decision makers and leaders seek out diverse perspectives and collaborate across teams and geographic areas, to make better decisions.
