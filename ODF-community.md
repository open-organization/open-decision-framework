**What it is**
  - A flexible, open approach to making business decisions and leading projects

**When to use it**

For decisions and projects that are likely to:
  - impact our culture or
  - affect associates beyond your immediate team

**How to use it**
  - Build steps from the Open Decision Framework into your project plan or decision-making process


What is an open decision?
-------------------------
_page 3 of 15_

<table>
<tr>
<td>Transparent</td>
<td>Inclusive</td>
<td>Customer-Centric</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Explain who is making the decision, what problems you're trying to solve, the requirements and constraints involved, and the process you will follow.</td>
<td>Engage others for feedback and collaborate throughout the decision-making process. Seek out diverse perspectives, including potential detractors.</td>
<td>Think of people as customers with competing needs and priorities. When a decision will help some customers, but disappoint others, manage relationships and expectations while getting stuff done.</td>
</tr>
</table>


Open decisions are made using open source principles 
-----------------------------------------------------
_page 4 of 15_ 

**Open exchange**

Whether you're developing software or trying to solve a business problem, open exchange begins when you share your "source code" with others. A free exchange of ideas is critical to creating an environment where people are allowed to learn and use existing information toward creating new ideas.

**Participation**

When we are free to collaborate, we create. We can solve problems that no one person may be able to solve on their own. And when we can implement open standards, we enable others to participate in the future.

**Release early + often**

Rapid prototypes can lead to rapid failures, and that leads to better solutions faster. When you're free to experiment, you can look at problems in new ways and look for answers in new places. You can learn by doing.

**Meritocracy**

In a meritocracy, good ideas can come from anywhere, and the best ideas win. Everyone has access to the same information. Successful work determines which projects rise and gather support and effort from the community.

**Community**

Communities are formed around a common purpose. They bring together diverse ideas and share work. Together, a global community can create beyond the capabilities of any one individual. It multiplies effort and shares the work. Together, we can do more.

You can't please everyone. 
----------------------------------------------------
**But when you make open decisions, people feel...**  _page 6 of 15_ 

  - I understand why the decision was made and how it aligns to Red Hat's strategy, goals, and mission.
  - There was visibility to the business requirements, research, and evaluation criteria.
  - The decision-making process was inclusive and transparent.
  - Although I wasn't the decision maker, I was able to contribute to the process.
  - I may not agree with the decision, but it's obvious that the decision makers understand Red Hat's values and culture.
  - I might be disappointed, but I wasn't surprised.
  - My voice was heard and valued.

<strong>Lead with transparency</strong><br/>
 • Publish a problem statement and possible approaches<br/><br/>
 • Identify any aspects of the project or decision that cannot be open<br/><br/>
 • Publish your ideation process<br/><br/>

<strong>Build diversity of thought + an inclusive environment</strong><br/>
 • Engage internal customers and stakeholders early on, especially those who may disagree<br/><br/>
 • Seek out diverse and underrepresented perspectives (geographies, ethnicity, departments, job levels, gender, age, etc.)<br/><br/>
 • Champion collaboration and provide channels for feedback<br/><br/>
 • Address risks, limitations, and potential cultural impacts, especially with historically controversial issues<br/><br/>
</td>

</td>
<td rowspan=3>
There are a handful of issues that often generate controversy and upset within Red Hat, including:<br/><br/>
 • Decisions, policies, or changes that impact associates, such as rewards and wellness programs<br/><br/>
 • Changes to associates' work environment<Br/><br/>
 • Implementation of proprietary technology<br/><br/>
 • Use of proprietary formats<Br/><br/>
 • Data privacy and sharing<br/><br/>

If your project or decision involves any of these themes, take extra steps to make your process open, inclusive, and transparent.

Appendix 
===========================================================================

History: Where the Open Decision Framework came from 
----------------------------------------------------
_page 14 of 15_ 

  - Based on principles practiced by open source communities

    - Research by Duke University's Fuqua School of Business and Diana Martin (2009 – 2010); additional community resources

  - Developed by the People team, with contributions from cross-functional focus group

    - Grew from People team Project Management Office's effort to create an open project management methodology (2012 – 2013)
    - Google Calendar memo-list conversations served as a catalyst to share drafts with all associates and invite participation (2014)
    - Tested by IT and Engineering, in the Google Calendar bridge working group (2014 – 2015)

  - Updated and maintained by Rebecca Fernandez (rfernand@redhat.com)


Why the framework exists 
------------------------
_page 15 of 15_ 

**A collection of proven practices that:**

  - Drive better alignment between business decisions and our company strategy, goals, culture, values, and mission
  - Demonstrate “what good looks like” in decision-making and communication
  - Offer consistent guidance for teams and leaders on Red Hat cultural expectations, balancing transparency and confidentiality
  - Improve associate engagement, signal-to-noise ratio on memo-list
